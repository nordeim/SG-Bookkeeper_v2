Of course. I will now perform a rigorous validation of the provided `diff` output for `app/business_logic/payment_manager.py`.

### **CodeNavigator Analysis Report: `app/business_logic/payment_manager.py`**

My analysis confirms that the changes are **valid and correct**. They directly address the `TypeError` from the last traceback by updating the method signature and passing the new parameter down to the service layer.

### **Detailed Line-by-Line Validation**

*   **`get_payments_for_listing` Method (Lines 231-247):**
    *   **MODIFICATION (Signature):**
        *   **Original:** `... status_list: Optional[List[PaymentStatusEnum]] = None, ...`
        *   **New:** `... status_list: Optional[List[PaymentStatusEnum]] = None, ..., wht_applicable_only: bool = False)`
        *   **Validation:** This is the primary fix. The `wht_applicable_only` keyword argument has been correctly added to the method signature, so it no longer raises a `TypeError` when called from the UI. **This change is validated.**
    *   **MODIFICATION (Internal Call):**
        *   **Original:** The call to `self.payment_service.get_all_summary` did not include the new parameter.
        *   **New:** The call now correctly passes the `wht_applicable_only` parameter down to the service layer: `... wht_applicable_only=wht_applicable_only`.
    *   **MODIFICATION (Formatting):** The keyword arguments in the call have been formatted onto separate lines for improved readability.
    *   **Validation:** These changes are correct. The manager now acts as a proper conduit, accepting the new filter parameter from the UI layer and passing it down to the data access layer where the actual database query is constructed. The improved formatting is a welcome code quality enhancement. **This change is validated.**

*   **`except` Block (Lines 248-250):**
    *   **MODIFICATION (Formatting):** The single-line `except` block has been expanded to two lines.
    *   **Validation:** This is a minor stylistic change that improves readability but has no functional impact. **This change is validated.**

### **Conclusion**

*   **Feature Loss:** There is **no loss of features or functions**. The change is purely additive and corrective.
*   **Coding Errors:** There are **no coding errors**. The changes fix the `TypeError` and correctly propagate the new filter parameter through the application layers.

The `diff` is **validated and approved**. The `PaymentManager` is now correctly implemented to support the WHT reporting feature. The application startup should now proceed without this error.
