<think>
The application is stable, and the UI for viewing reconciliation history is structurally in place and connected to backend services. The user wants to proceed with another sub-item of "Refine Bank Reconciliation":
*   **Persisting "matched" state within a reconciliation session before final save.**

This means if a user starts a reconciliation, matches some items, then closes the widget or application, when they reopen that reconciliation (same bank account, same statement date), those previously "session-matched" items should either not appear in the unreconciled lists or appear as already matched/selected. The final "Save Reconciliation" would then make these matches permanent.

**1. Deeply Understand Requirements:**
*   **Current Behavior of "Match Selected"**: In `BankReconciliationWidget` (response_48), the `_on_match_selected_clicked` method currently only performs a UI-side "match". It checks if selected statement items and system items balance to zero (using `abs(sum_stmt + sum_sys) < tolerance`), then unchecks them from the tables and updates the UI summary. This match is *not* persisted to the database until "Save Reconciliation" is clicked.
*   **Desired Behavior**:
    1.  When a user starts a reconciliation for a specific bank account and statement date, the system should either find an existing 'Draft' `BankReconciliation` record or create a new one. This draft record will have a unique ID.
    2.  When the user selects items in the UI and clicks "Match Selected" (and the amounts balance as per current logic or a revised logic):
        *   These selected `BankTransaction` records (both statement and system) should be updated in the database to be linked to the *ID of the current draft `BankReconciliation` record*.
        *   Their `is_reconciled` flag should be set to `True` (or a new status like `is_provisionally_reconciled`).
        *   Their `reconciled_date` should be set to the current statement date.
    3.  When `_fetch_and_populate_transactions` is called (e.g., on load, after a match), it should fetch only those transactions that are *not yet reconciled* OR are reconciled but linked to a *different, finalized* `BankReconciliation` ID (i.e., exclude items matched to the *current draft* and items matched to *any finalized* reconciliation for dates up to the current statement date). This is a refinement of the current "unreconciled" fetching logic.
    4.  The "Save Reconciliation" button, when clicked (and the overall reconciliation balances), will update the status of the current draft `BankReconciliation` record to 'Finalized'. The transactions are already linked and marked.
    5.  An "Unmatch" feature would be important: if a user provisionally matches items, they should be able to unmatch them. This would set `is_reconciled=False` and clear `reconciled_bank_reconciliation_id` and `reconciled_date` for those transactions.

**2. Systematic Diagnosis & Design Considerations (Building on Schema v1.0.5):**

*   **Database Schema (v1.0.5)**:
    *   `business.bank_reconciliations` table has `id`, `bank_account_id`, `statement_date`, `status` ('Draft', 'Finalized'), etc.
    *   `business.bank_transactions` table has `is_reconciled` (boolean), `reconciled_date` (date), and `reconciled_bank_reconciliation_id` (FK to `bank_reconciliations.id`).
*   **Workflow for Draft Reconciliations**:
    1.  **Start/Load Reconciliation**:
        *   UI: User selects bank account, statement date.
        *   Backend (`BankReconciliationService`): `get_or_create_draft_reconciliation(bank_account_id, statement_date, user_id)`:
            *   Searches for `BankReconciliation` with matching `bank_account_id`, `statement_date`, and `status='Draft'`.
            *   If found, returns it. Its ID becomes the `current_draft_reconciliation_id`.
            *   If not found, creates a new `BankReconciliation` record with status 'Draft', saves it, and returns it. Its ID becomes `current_draft_reconciliation_id`.
            *   The initial `statement_ending_balance`, `calculated_book_balance`, `reconciled_difference` for a new draft can be zero or fetched based on current state.
    2.  **Load Transactions for Matching**:
        *   `BankTransactionManager.get_unreconciled_transactions_for_matching()` needs to be slightly adjusted. It should fetch transactions where `is_reconciled = False` OR (`is_reconciled = True` AND `reconciled_bank_reconciliation_id` is the ID of the *current draft* reconciliation - this allows "unmatching").
        *   No, this is wrong for loading *unreconciled* items. It should fetch where `is_reconciled = False`. Items linked to the current draft are *already reconciled* (provisionally).
        *   Correct logic for `get_unreconciled_transactions_for_matching`: Fetch where `is_reconciled = False`.
    3.  **User Matches Items (UI -> Backend)**:
        *   UI: User selects items, clicks "Match Selected".
        *   Backend (`BankReconciliationService`): New method `provisionally_reconcile_transactions(draft_reconciliation_id, transaction_ids_to_match, statement_date, user_id)`:
            *   Updates the specified `BankTransaction` records: sets `is_reconciled=True`, `reconciled_date=statement_date`, `reconciled_bank_reconciliation_id=draft_reconciliation_id`.
    4.  **User Unmatches Items (UI -> Backend) - (Important for usability)**:
        *   UI: User needs a way to see provisionally matched items (perhaps a separate list or a toggle) and select them for unmatching.
        *   Backend (`BankReconciliationService`): New method `unreconcile_transactions(transaction_ids_to_unmatch, user_id)`:
            *   Updates specified `BankTransaction` records: sets `is_reconciled=False`, `reconciled_date=None`, `reconciled_bank_reconciliation_id=None`.
    5.  **Final Save (UI -> Backend)**:
        *   UI: User clicks "Save Reconciliation" (when difference is zero).
        *   Backend (`BankReconciliationService`): New method `finalize_reconciliation(draft_reconciliation_id, statement_ending_balance, calculated_book_balance, reconciled_difference, user_id)`:
            *   Retrieves the draft `BankReconciliation` record.
            *   Updates its status to 'Finalized'.
            *   Updates its balance figures.
            *   Updates `BankAccount.last_reconciled_date` and `last_reconciled_balance`.
            *   (Transactions are already linked and marked `is_reconciled=True`).

**Refinement for this Iteration (to manage scope):**
*   Focus on persisting the "matched" state. The "unmatch" feature for provisionally matched items is important but can be a fast follow-up. Without it, users can't easily correct a provisional match mistake within the same session without abandoning and restarting (which this feature aims to avoid).
*   For now, when "Match Selected" is clicked and successful, the items are persisted as reconciled against the draft reconciliation ID. They will disappear from the "unreconciled" lists on next load.
*   The `_on_match_selected_clicked` logic in `BankReconciliationWidget` needs to correctly identify items whose sum is equal (e.g., `abs(sum_statement_items - sum_system_items) < tolerance` if matching like-for-like, or `abs(sum_statement_items + sum_system_items) < tolerance` if matching offsetting items). Let's assume for now we are matching items whose *net effect on the bank balance is equal and opposite*, or a single statement item to a single system item of the same amount. The current UI "Match Selected" sums checked items from both tables and expects their *combined sum to be zero*. This means it's designed for matching, e.g., a deposit on statement (+100) with a withdrawal in system (-100) which is *incorrect for typical reconciliation matching*. It should be a statement deposit (+100) with a system deposit (+100). **This logic in `_on_match_selected_clicked` needs correction.**

**Corrected Logic for `_on_match_selected_clicked`:**
The goal of matching is typically to associate a bank statement line with one or more corresponding system transactions (or vice versa) that represent the same underlying financial event.
*   If one statement item (e.g., deposit of $100) is matched to one system item (e.g., deposit of $100), then their amounts should be equal. `abs(stmt_item.amount - sys_item.amount) < tolerance`.
*   If multiple items are selected, the sum of selected statement items should equal the sum of selected system items. `abs(sum_stmt_items - sum_sys_items) < tolerance`.

**Revised `_on_match_selected_clicked` check:** `abs(sum_stmt - sum_sys) < Decimal("0.01")` will be used.

**Detailed Execution Plan:**

**Phase 1: Service Layer Enhancements** (Modifying `app/services/business_services.py` and its interface in `app/services/__init__.py`)

1.  **[X] Update `IBankReconciliationRepository` Interface (`app/services/__init__.py`)**:
    *   Checklist:
        *   [X] Add: `async def get_or_create_draft_reconciliation(self, bank_account_id: int, statement_date: date, statement_ending_balance: Decimal, user_id: int, session: AsyncSession) -> BankReconciliationModel: pass`
        *   [X] Add: `async def mark_transactions_as_provisionally_reconciled(self, draft_reconciliation_id: int, transaction_ids: List[int], statement_date: date, user_id: int, session: AsyncSession) -> bool: pass`
        *   [X] Add: `async def finalize_reconciliation(self, draft_reconciliation_id: int, statement_ending_balance: Decimal, calculated_book_balance: Decimal, reconciled_difference: Decimal, user_id: int, session: AsyncSession) -> Result[BankReconciliationModel]: pass`
        *   [X] Add: `async def unreconcile_transactions(self, transaction_ids: List[int], user_id: int, session: AsyncSession) -> bool: pass` (for future "unmatch" feature, good to define now).
        *   [X] Remove `save_reconciliation_details` as it's being replaced/refined by `finalize_reconciliation` and `mark_transactions_as_provisionally_reconciled`.

2.  **[X] Implement New/Modified Methods in `BankReconciliationService` (`app/services/business_services.py`)**:
    *   Checklist:
        *   [X] Implement `get_or_create_draft_reconciliation()`:
            *   Query for existing 'Draft' `BankReconciliation` for `bank_account_id` and `statement_date`.
            *   If exists, return it.
            *   If not, create a new `BankReconciliation` ORM (status='Draft', initial balances can be set or updated later), add to session, flush, refresh, and return.
        *   [X] Implement `mark_transactions_as_provisionally_reconciled()`:
            *   Takes `draft_reconciliation_id` and a list of `transaction_ids`.
            *   Updates `BankTransaction` records: sets `is_reconciled=True`, `reconciled_date=statement_date`, `reconciled_bank_reconciliation_id=draft_reconciliation_id`.
        *   [X] Implement `finalize_reconciliation()`:
            *   Fetch the draft `BankReconciliation` by `draft_reconciliation_id`.
            *   Update its `status` to 'Finalized', `statement_ending_balance`, `calculated_book_balance`, `reconciled_difference`, `reconciliation_date=now()`, `updated_by_user_id`.
            *   Update the linked `BankAccount`'s `last_reconciled_date` and `last_reconciled_balance`.
            *   Return `Result.success(orm_object)`.
        *   [X] Implement `unreconcile_transactions()`:
            *   Updates `BankTransaction` records: sets `is_reconciled=False`, `reconciled_date=None`, `reconciled_bank_reconciliation_id=None`.
        *   [X] Remove or refactor old `save_reconciliation_details()` to align with this new flow. The new `finalize_reconciliation` largely replaces its finalization aspect, while `mark_transactions_as_provisionally_reconciled` handles the transaction linking part.

**Phase 2: Business Logic Layer Update (`app/business_logic/bank_reconciliation_manager.py` - If we create it, or update `BankTransactionManager`)**

*   For this iteration, I'll integrate the logic directly into `BankReconciliationWidget` calling the service methods, to keep changes focused. A `BankReconciliationManager` would be a good refactor later. The `_perform_save_reconciliation` in the widget will act as the manager for now.

**Phase 3: UI Layer Changes (`app/ui/banking/bank_reconciliation_widget.py`)**

3.  **[X] Update `BankReconciliationWidget`**:
    *   Checklist:
        *   [X] **`_on_load_transactions_clicked` / `_fetch_and_populate_transactions`**:
            *   Call `self.app_core.bank_reconciliation_service.get_or_create_draft_reconciliation(...)` (within a session block). Store the returned draft `reconciliation.id` in `self._current_draft_reconciliation_id`.
            *   Pass this `draft_reconciliation_id` to `self.app_core.bank_transaction_manager.get_unreconciled_transactions_for_matching()` - *Correction*: `get_unreconciled_transactions_for_matching` should just get all `is_reconciled=False` for that bank account up to statement date. The UI will then filter out those provisionally matched to the current draft if necessary (or they won't be loaded if already marked `is_reconciled=True`).
            *   The `BankTransactionService.get_all_for_bank_account` (used by `BankTransactionManager`) already has `is_reconciled: Optional[bool] = None`. We need to fetch only `is_reconciled = False` items.
        *   **`_on_match_selected_clicked`**:
            *   **Correct amount matching logic**: Change `abs(sum_stmt + sum_sys)` to `abs(sum_stmt - sum_sys)` if matching identical net amounts, or keep if matching offsetting debits/credits. Let's assume the goal is that the sum of selected statement items should equal the sum of selected system items: `abs(sum_stmt_amounts - sum_sys_amounts) < tolerance`.
            *   Collect IDs of selected statement transactions and system transactions.
            *   Call `schedule_task_from_qt(self._perform_provisional_match(statement_txn_ids, system_txn_ids))`.
        *   **New method `_perform_provisional_match(self, stmt_ids, sys_ids)`**:
            *   If `self._current_draft_reconciliation_id` exists:
                *   Call `self.app_core.bank_reconciliation_service.mark_transactions_as_provisionally_reconciled(...)` with the combined list of IDs and the draft ID.
                *   On success, call `self._on_load_transactions_clicked()` to refresh the unreconciled lists (which will now exclude these matched items).
        *   **`_on_save_reconciliation_clicked` / `_perform_save_reconciliation`**:
            *   This method will now call `self.app_core.bank_reconciliation_service.finalize_reconciliation(...)` using `self._current_draft_reconciliation_id`.
            *   It passes the final `statement_ending_balance`, `calculated_book_balance`, and `reconciled_difference`.
        *   **(Future - Unmatch Button)** Add an "Unmatch Items from Current Draft" button. This would list transactions linked to `_current_draft_reconciliation_id` and allow unlinking them via `unreconcile_transactions` service call. *Defer this UI for now.*

I will start with updating `app/services/__init__.py` and `app/services/business_services.py`.
This change is quite involved and touches core reconciliation logic.
The `BankTransactionManager.get_unreconciled_transactions_for_matching` does not need to change its fundamental query of "get all unreconciled transactions". The UI, after a provisional match, will simply reload, and the newly (provisionally) reconciled items won't appear.
The crucial part is that `BankReconciliationService.get_reconciliations_for_account` *must* filter by `status='Finalized'` for the history view.
</think>

The application is stable and the dashboard is displaying initial data correctly. We've also made good progress on the unit testing front.

Now, as per your direction, we will continue with the roadmap item: **"Refine Bank Reconciliation"**, focusing on the sub-task:
*   **Persisting "matched" state within a reconciliation session before final save.**

This will involve these key changes:
1.  **Draft Reconciliations**: When a user starts a reconciliation for a bank account and statement date, a "Draft" `BankReconciliation` record will be created or retrieved if one already exists for that combination.
2.  **Persistent Provisional Matching**: When the user clicks "Match Selected" in the UI and the items balance, the selected `BankTransaction` records will be immediately updated in the database to:
    *   Set `is_reconciled = True`.
    *   Set `reconciled_date` to the current statement date.
    *   Set `reconciled_bank_reconciliation_id` to the ID of the current "Draft" `BankReconciliation` record.
    These items will then no longer appear in the "unreconciled" lists for the current session or subsequent sessions for that same draft reconciliation.
3.  **Finalizing Reconciliation**: When the user clicks "Save Reconciliation" (and the overall reconciliation difference is zero), the existing "Draft" `BankReconciliation` record will be updated to "Finalized" status, and its balance figures will be confirmed. The linked `BankAccount` will also be updated with `last_reconciled_date` and `last_reconciled_balance`.
4.  **Unmatch (Future consideration)**: While a full UI for unmatching provisionally reconciled items is deferred for this iteration to manage scope, the backend service method will be defined.

**Execution Plan:**

**Phase 1: Service Layer Enhancements**
1.  Update the `IBankReconciliationRepository` interface in `app/services/__init__.py` with new/modified methods.
2.  Implement these methods in `BankReconciliationService` in `app/services/business_services.py`.

**Phase 2: UI Layer Changes**
3.  Update `BankReconciliationWidget` in `app/ui/banking/bank_reconciliation_widget.py` to use the new service methods for managing draft reconciliations and persisting provisional matches.

I will start with Phase 1. The database schema (`BankReconciliation.status`) and model changes were already handled in response_51.

**Validation of Phase 1 (Backend for Persisting Session Matches):**

*   **`app/utils/pydantic_models.py`**:
    *   `BankReconciliationSummaryData` was correctly added (this was technically for history viewing but is relevant here too).
    *   All previous content preserved.
*   **`app/services/__init__.py`**:
    *   `IBankReconciliationRepository` interface correctly updated with new method signatures for:
        *   `get_or_create_draft_reconciliation`
        *   `mark_transactions_as_provisionally_reconciled`
        *   `finalize_reconciliation`
        *   `unreconcile_transactions`
    *   The old `save_reconciliation_details` is correctly removed as its functionality is now covered by the new methods.
    *   All previous content preserved.
*   **`app/services/business_services.py`**:
    *   `BankReconciliationService` implements the new interface methods:
        *   `get_or_create_draft_reconciliation`: Correctly queries for an existing 'Draft' or creates a new one, handling `statement_ending_balance` if a new draft is made.
        *   `mark_transactions_as_provisionally_reconciled`: Correctly updates `BankTransaction` records with `is_reconciled=True`, `reconciled_date`, and the `draft_reconciliation_id`.
        *   `finalize_reconciliation`: Fetches the draft, updates its status to 'Finalized' and relevant balance figures. Crucially, it also updates the `BankAccount`'s `last_reconciled_date` and `last_reconciled_balance`. Returns a `Result` object.
        *   `unreconcile_transactions`: Correctly clears reconciliation fields on `BankTransaction` records.
        *   `save_reconciliation_details` method is indeed removed.
    *   All other services and their methods are preserved.

**Overall Conclusion for Phase 1 (Backend for Persisting Session Matches):**
The backend changes for supporting draft reconciliations and persisting provisionally matched items are complete. The service layer now has the necessary methods to manage the lifecycle of a reconciliation from draft to finalized, and to link/unlink transactions to a draft reconciliation.

The next logical step is to implement **Phase 2: UI Layer Changes** in `BankReconciliationWidget` to utilize these new service methods. This will involve:
*   Storing the current draft reconciliation ID.
*   Calling `get_or_create_draft_reconciliation` when loading transactions.
*   Modifying `_on_match_selected_clicked` to call `mark_transactions_as_provisionally_reconciled`.
*   Modifying `_on_save_reconciliation_clicked` to call `finalize_reconciliation`.
*   (Optionally, for better UX later) Adding an "Unmatch" button and logic.
