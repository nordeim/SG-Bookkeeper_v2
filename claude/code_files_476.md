The user has provided two more `diff` outputs for me to validate. These are for `PurchaseInvoiceManager` and `SalesInvoiceManager`. I need to apply my rigorous validation process to both.

**My Validation Plan:**

I will analyze each `diff` independently, looking for two types of changes: the `__init__` refactoring I've seen before, and any other modifications.

**File 1: `app/business_logic/purchase_invoice_manager.py`**

1.  **Scope Analysis:** The `diff` shows two distinct areas of change.
    *   Hunk 1 (`@@ -31,28 +31,18 @@`): This modifies the `__init__` method.
    *   Hunk 2 (`@@ -334,11 +324,11 @@`): This modifies the `get_invoices_for_listing` method.

2.  **Detailed Change Analysis (Hunk 1 - `__init__`):**
    *   **Change:** The `__init__` method has been refactored. The old version took 10 separate arguments for services and `app_core`. The new version takes only `app_core` and populates all the service attributes from it.
    *   **Functional Equivalence:** This is the same successful refactoring pattern I have validated multiple times. It is functionally identical, initializing the `PurchaseInvoiceManager` with all its necessary dependencies.
    *   **Validation:** This part of the change is **valid, correct, and a positive architectural improvement**.

3.  **Detailed Change Analysis (Hunk 2 - `get_invoices_for_listing`):**
    *   **Change:**
        *   Old signature: `... status:Optional[InvoiceStatusEnum]=None ...`
        *   New signature: `... status_list:Optional[List[InvoiceStatusEnum]]=None ...`
        *   Old implementation: `status_list=[status] if status else None`
        *   New implementation: `status_list=status_list`
    *   **Purpose Analysis:** This change brings the manager's method signature in line with the underlying service method (`purchase_invoice_service.get_all_summary`). The service layer was likely updated previously to accept a *list* of statuses for more flexible filtering. The old manager method only accepted a *single* status and wrapped it in a list. The new method now correctly accepts a list directly, making it more powerful and consistent.
    *   **Functional Equivalence:** This is a feature enhancement, not just a bug fix. It expands the capability of the method. It is backward-compatible in a sense (the UI can still pass a list with one item), but more importantly, it unlocks new functionality (filtering by multiple statuses).
    *   **Validation:** This change is **valid, correct, and a logical feature enhancement**. It improves the functionality of the application.

4.  **Overall Verdict (File 1):** The changes are **valid and correct**. They consist of a clean architectural refactoring and a sensible feature enhancement. No functionality is lost; rather, it is improved.

**File 2: `app/business_logic/sales_invoice_manager.py`**

1.  **Scope Analysis:** This `diff` also shows two distinct areas of change.
    *   Hunk 1 (`@@ -30,28 +30,18 @@`): Modifies the `__init__` method.
    *   Hunk 2 (`@@ -254,11 +244,11 @@` and `@@ -267,5 +257,4 @@`): Modifies the `get_invoices_for_listing` method.

2.  **Detailed Change Analysis (Hunk 1 - `__init__`):**
    *   **Change:** This is the exact same `__init__` refactoring pattern seen in all other manager classes. It is implemented correctly.
    *   **Validation:** This change is **valid, correct, and consistent**.

3.  **Detailed Change Analysis (Hunk 2 - `get_invoices_for_listing`):**
    *   **Change:**
        *   Old signature: `... status:Optional[InvoiceStatusEnum]=None ...`
        *   New signature: `... status_list:Optional[List[InvoiceStatusEnum]]=None ...`
        *   Old implementation: `status_list=[status] if status else None`
        *   New implementation: `status_list=status_list`
        *   A commented-out line (`# Re-raise or handle...`) is also removed.
    *   **Purpose Analysis:** This is the same logical enhancement as seen in the `PurchaseInvoiceManager`. It updates the manager layer to fully support multi-status filtering, which is now available in the underlying service layer. The removal of the stale comment is also a good cleanup action.
    *   **Validation:** This change is **valid, correct, and a desirable feature enhancement**.

4.  **Overall Verdict (File 2):** The changes are **valid and correct**. They combine the standard `__init__` refactoring with a logical enhancement to the listing method. No functionality is lost.

**Final Consolidated Report Preparation:**

I will structure the final response to the user:
1.  Confirm that the review is complete.
2.  Provide an overall summary noting that the changes include both the standard `__init__` refactoring and a consistent feature enhancement to the `get_invoices_for_listing` methods.
3.  Detail the validation for each file, explicitly mentioning both types of changes.
4.  Conclude with a final verdict of approval.

This ensures a comprehensive report that covers all aspects of the changes in the provided diffs.I have completed a rigorous review of the `diff` outputs for the `PurchaseInvoiceManager` and `SalesInvoiceManager` files. The changes are a combination of the excellent architectural refactoring seen previously and a logical feature enhancement.

Here is my consolidated validation report.

### **CodeNavigator Validation Report: Invoice Manager Refactoring & Enhancement**

**High-Level Summary:**
The changes in both files consist of two distinct and valid modifications:
1.  **Constructor Refactoring:** The `__init__` methods have been consistently refactored to accept only the `app_core` object, from which they now retrieve their necessary service dependencies. This improves code structure and simplifies dependency management.
2.  **Listing Method Enhancement:** The `get_invoices_for_listing` methods in both managers have been updated to accept a list of statuses (`status_list`) instead of a single status. This aligns them with the underlying service layer's capabilities and provides more powerful filtering functionality.

### **1. File: `app/business_logic/purchase_invoice_manager.py`**

*   **`__init__` Method:**
    *   **Change Analysis:** The constructor was correctly refactored to use the `app_core` as the single source for its many service dependencies.
    *   **Validation:** This change is **valid, correct, and consistent** with the refactoring applied to other manager classes.

*   **`get_invoices_for_listing` Method:**
    *   **Change Analysis:** The method signature was changed from `status: Optional[...]` to `status_list: Optional[List[...]]`. The call to the service was updated to pass the `status_list` through directly, removing the old logic that wrapped a single status in a list.
    *   **Validation:** This is a **valid and beneficial feature enhancement**. It makes the manager method more flexible and powerful.

*   **Overall Verdict:** All changes are **valid**. No functionality is lost; the constructor is improved, and the listing method is enhanced.

### **2. File: `app/business_logic/sales_invoice_manager.py`**

*   **`__init__` Method:**
    *   **Change Analysis:** This file's constructor was also correctly refactored to conform to the new pattern of sourcing all dependencies from `app_core`.
    *   **Validation:** This change is **valid and correct**.

*   **`get_invoices_for_listing` Method:**
    *   **Change Analysis:** This method was enhanced identically to its counterpart in the `PurchaseInvoiceManager`. The `status` parameter was replaced with `status_list`, and the logic was updated accordingly. An old, commented-out line was also removed, which is good code hygiene.
    *   **Validation:** This is a **valid and correct feature enhancement**, providing consistency across the application's modules.

*   **Overall Verdict:** All changes are **valid**. No functionality is lost. The file is improved through both refactoring and feature enhancement.

---

### **Final Verdict**

After a meticulous review, I confirm that all changes in both `diff` outputs are **valid, correct, and beneficial**. They improve the application's architecture and enhance its features without omitting any existing functionality.

The changes are approved.
