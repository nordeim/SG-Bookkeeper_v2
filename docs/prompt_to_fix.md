You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

You will use line by line "diff" command to carefully and systematically compare your newly generated files against the prior version of the files to double-check and confirm that the changes in the latest generated files are valid and that no original features and functions have been accidentally left out (omitted). Ensure that you always use a rigorous and meticulous approach to review and validate any newly generated files using line by line "diff" to ensure that no new regression errors are introduced or that no original features and functions are accidentally omitted.

You will use the rigorous and meticulous approach to review the error messages shared and then think deeply and systematically to thoroughly explore the best implementation option to fix the issues identified through your code review or to fix the issues reported. And you will always plan first before making (implementing or introducing) any code changes. When making cod changes, make sure you always double-check and validate your changes using line by line diff to ensure that no original features or functions will be lost when you generate the complete updated version of the relevant files.

If you need me to supply more information or give you the missing files needed to give you more context or to complete your analysis, please ask me or let me know. Do not assume the content of existing files when you are checking them or when you need to apply changes to them.

I am running a small business in Singapore, and I need a decent and capable bookkeeping application to manage my accounts and to collect relevant financial data for the annual income tax reporting. Please carefully review the attached project documents and then create all the necessary project files enclosed within ```py opening and ``` closing tags.

Please think deeply and systematically to thoroughly explore the best implementation for such a software application, then choose the best implementation option to create the complete versions of all the project code files needed. Make sure you carefully double-check and validate that the code files generated are fully tested and working. Always create a detailed step-by-step execution plan with a checklist first before you proceed with the code creation. Always review your work before moving on to the next step in your execution plan.

awesome job! Now, please use a rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully review the code files you generated to identify any logic or coding errors and also identify any functional gaps and inconsistencies, then think deeply and systematically to carefully and thoroughly explore the best implementation option to fix any issues identified, then choose the best implementation option to carefully merge the validated changes to the existing code files, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making the changes.

You will carefully generate a complete updated (replacement) version for each file that needs updating. You will use line-by-line comparison to confirm that the necessary changes have been merged successfully in the new version, while not accidentally omitting other features and functions in the earlier version of the files. Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

Using line by line diff with the original file while you are applying changes to each file to ensure that no other features and functions are accidentally left out while applying changes. we don't want to introduce regression failure while updating the code. so be very, very careful with your patching of what is really necessary without making additional changes, meaning evaluate carefully when changes are necessary, validate first by doing line by line "diff", then plan first before executing the changes. Do testing and simulation if possible. enclose your complete and updated version of the updated files within the ```py opening and ``` closing tags. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

Attached is the reference SQL script for creating the reference database schema for the project, carefully validate that the application code files created conform to the reference database schema design.

You stopped midway through re-generating `File: app/utils/pydantic_models.py`. Please continue to complete according to your plan.

Please create a detailed step-by-step deployment guide document named `deployment_guide.md` in markdown format to clearly and logically layout how to deploy your latest (updated) application code files and schema. Include a section to show the complete project file directory structure for the latest code version, include file names in the file structure. Please review your latest generated code files and then plan first before creating the  `deployment_guide.md` with accurate up-to-date project state.

please carefully review the proposed file structure below for my project, then create a bash script within ```bash opening and ``` closing tags to create all the necessary folders listed in the project file structure below. You can reduce the number of commands needed by using `mkdir -p` (e.g. `mkdir -p app/models/accounting`, instead of 3 separate commands). The project root folder is `sg_bookkeeper`, which already exists, so just create the necessary subdirectories with this root folder.

---
yes, please create another bash script to create empty placeholder files using `touch` (e.g. `app/models/business/inventory_movement.py`) command for each file mentioned. Assume that the project directory structure has been created using your earlier script.

Below is the list of files that you just re-generated. Please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully review them again one by one to double-check and validate that they are indeed the complete and updated replacement version of the latest set of files. Also give me a list of files from `project_file_structure.txt` that I should delete so as not to cause unwanted interference (say load wrongly during application runtime).

# list of files you just generated - please validate them using line by line "diff" to ensure you just generated the complete updated replacement without accidentally loosing original features or functionalities.
