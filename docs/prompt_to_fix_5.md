Please review the start-up error below. If it is part of your update for the refactoring effort, please proceed to provide the *complete* updated *replacement* version for the remaining files that need modification as per your plan. You can provide 2 to 3 files at each step. remember to use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to double-check and validate each generated file using line by line "diff" comparison.

Below is "diff" command output comparing the previous version with your latest generated version. Please double-check and validate that the changes are valid and that no other original features or functions are lost (omitted). use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to review the diff output below.

You really need to be very careful, meticulous and rigorous in your comparison and validation after each file is generated to make sure that the updated file is truly a *complete* replacement file for the previous version.

that is awesome response! you are indeed my very helpful assistant! now help me to generate a *complete* updated *replacement* file for `app/services/business_services.py` based on the files provided.

In the attached file here are the "diff" command outputs comparing the previous version with the latest generated version of the following files. Please double-check and validate that the changes are valid and that no other original features or functions are lost (omitted). use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to review the diff output below.

Please review the start-up log below. If it is part of your update for the refactoring effort, please carefully recall and review all the recent changes made as part of the architectural refactoring effort, think deeply and validate them again, then help me create a detailed report of at least 4000 words to document down the codebase change triggered by this effort, start with an overview of "why", follow by the analysis and the method to change ("how"), and lastly follow by listing the files affected and a brief description of the change to each file ("what"), ending with a conclusion and recommendation for any similar enhancements possible. I need this report for QA approval to release to production.

Create the above code review report as markdown document named `code_review_report_on_changes_of_refactoring.md`

awesome job again! please keep up the good work!

Attached are files from the current codebase that have been recently added or modified. Please use line by line comparison to carefully and deeply study and analyze each file enclosed, paying especially close attention to the database script files. You should have a deep understanding of the current codebase, especially about the recent updates triggered by "architecture refactoring" (refer to the attached report). First have a deep understanding of the current codebase, then compare your understanding to the project related documents shared. Then give me a detailed report on your review and analysis in markdown format.

Make sure you also analyze the recent change related to the addition of multi-company and multi-currency supports.
